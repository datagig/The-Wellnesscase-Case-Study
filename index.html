                                  This is a Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Certification. Bellabeat, 
                                 a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, is a successful small company. 
                                 Collecting data, through their health-focused smart products, on activity, sleep, stress, and 
                                 reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health 
                                 and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself
                                 as a tech-driven wellness company for women. Nevertheless, Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative
                                 Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth 
                                 opportunities for the company.   </p>

Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

                                As the junior data analyst, working on the marketing analyst team, I have been asked to focus
                                on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain information into how consumers
                                are using their smart devices. Sršen asks me  to analyze usage data in order to gain 
                                insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. She then wants me to select one Bellabeat
                                product to apply these insights to in my presentation.  I focused on Bellabeat’s Time. This wellness watch combines the 
                                timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress.
                                The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness. 
                                The goal is to drive my research through these three questions:

<p align="left" style = "text-indent:2cm" class="lead mb-5">  For this assignment  I used  the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, pointed by Sršen,  a public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits.

                     The dataset is available on  18 CSV files.  The data is considered long since each row is one time point per 
                     subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows. Sorted and filtered Pivot Tables were created
                     with the help of spreadsheets, in order 
                     to verify attributes, observations and relational information between tables </p>

                            in health-related products for women, the ideal data for this case study should come exclusively

                            I created a standard checklist to use before my data cleaning process. 
                           Like this, I  could efficiently and, hopefully, swiftly identify all the 
                           problem spots without getting sidetracked. Using this checklist  I can also
                           identify the scale and scope of the dataset itself.

                           Security copies of the data sets used were first made before starting so they could 
                           be accessed in the event data was accidentally lost during the cleaning process. 
                           I figured out the data I needed and that which I didn’t, a key part of this process.
                           Unwanted data was removed.
                           Using spreadsheets functions such as spellcheck, autocorrect and conditional formatting,
                           I proceeded to remove irrelevant data and duplicates  which could seriously affect my analysis results.
                           I removed  text extra spaces  and blanks which could  cause unexpected or confusing results when filtering,
                           sorting or searching through data.  
                           Typos were fixed and formatting was made consistent. Misspellings and punctuation were also corrected.
                           The PMDATA is recent and covers a 5-month period, however,  the original  dataset's files were in.json 
                           format, so ihe files had to be cleaned, combined, and converted to CSV.
 
                           Removing formatting was the next step in the cleaning data process.

        <p align="left" style = "text-indent:2cm" class="lead mb-5"> 
            Verification was done afterward to confirm the prior data-cleaning process was well 
            executed and the resulting data was accurate and reliable.This step was achieved by 
            checking back to the original unclean data set and comparing it to the clean set, 
            reviewing the dirty data and trying to identify any common problems. What I looked for, 
            this time, was for nulls, misspellings or errors of that sort, these can be easily fixed 
            with functions such FIND, TRIM, remove duplicates and conditional formatting. Pivot tables
            are also pretty helpful to sort, filter, reorganize, group, count, total and/or average data stored on a database.</p>
        <p align="left" style = "text-indent:2cm" class="lead mb-5"> 
           This stage is a great opportunity to step back one more time and take a look in a wider perspective to confirm whether this data 
            is addressing our business problem. It is a good moment to re-focus on the original problem by reviewing the business problem, 
            our project goal and finally, whether the data we collected is capable of solving the problem and meeting the project objectives.
            Here, it is particularly helpful to ask questions such as “Do the numbers in the data make sense?” </p>

                • Sources of errors: Did I use the right tools and functions to find the source of the errors in your dataset?
                     <br>
                • Null data: Did I search for NULLs using conditional formatting and filters?
                     <br>
                • Misspelled words: Did I locate all misspellings?
                     <br>
                • Mistyped numbers: Did I double-check that your numeric data has been entered correctly?
                     <br>
                • Extra spaces and characters: Did I remove any extra spaces or characters using the TRIM function?
                     <br>
                • Duplicates: Did I remove duplicates in spreadsheets using the Remove Duplicates function or DISTINCT in SQL?
                     <br>
                • Mismatched data types: Did I check that numeric, date, and string data are typecast correctly?
                     <br>
                • Messy (inconsistent) strings: Did I make sure that all of your strings are consistent and meaningful?
                     <br>
                • Messy (inconsistent) date formats: Did I format the dates consistently throughout your dataset?
                     <br>
                • Misleading variable labels (columns): Did I name your columns meaningfully?
                     <br>
                • Truncated data: Did I check for truncated or missing data that needs correction?
                     <br>
                • Business Logic: Did I check that the data makes sense given your knowledge of the business? </p>

             Lastly, to inform other users of changes I made, determine the quality of data, and recover in the 
            event data-cleaning errors happen, I relied on a changelog. Using Sheets Version History  to chronologically 
            record a list of modifications made to this data-cleaning project is my way to document and track changes, 
            additions, deletions and errors during my data-cleaning process. This documentation should also be useful for
            future data collection quality control procedures, if needed. </p>
